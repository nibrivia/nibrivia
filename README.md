### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing a batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I'm working on:

 - [Oak](https://github.com/nibrivia/oak): a weirdly-typed programming language that breaks the fourth wall: what does it mean to have first-class types? first-class expressions? what even is evaluation, really? (writeup incoming!)
 - (re)learning a bunch of stacks I've used, but never taken the time to deeply understand (ahem, CSS)
 - doing a bunch of miscellaneous projects on public transit, baseball, electricity markets, and more...

I will be looking for a job at the conclusion of the batch (mid-February 2024), if you happen to be hiring, know of a job who would be a good fit, let me know :)

If you're a recruiter: _Hi! I hope you're having a wonderful day ðŸ’®._
This section is for you.

My skills generally lie in my breadth of expertise: I am effective in [Haskell](https://github.com/nibrivia/oak/tree/olivia/rewrite), [Python](https://github.com/nibrivia/darksky-terminal-weather), [Rust](https://github.com/nibrivia/rusty-beaver), with [high-performance parallel computing (also Rust)](https://github.com/nibrivia/rustasim), [data analysis (R)](https://github.com/nibrivia/plotypus), and full-stack applications.
(The selection of these projects is necessarily limited due to IP constraints.)

My ability to explain (very) technical concepts to a less-technical audience is frequently highlighted, most publicly by MIT in its [highest teaching award for students](https://oge.mit.edu/community-diversity/awards-recognition/the-goodwin-medal/2020-olivia-brode-roger/) for my work teaching Computer Systems (OSes, Networks, Distributed Systems, and Security), and Digital Design (from transistors to an OS).
At every org I've been a part of, I've been praised for being able to identify and fix systemic issues, communicate across teams/departments , and "being a multiplier" for the team.

If you're looking for an expert to build/lead your team in $X, that's (probably) not going to be me.
If you're looking for someone who can effectively solve challenges as they come up, no matter the stack, and no matter the historical decisions that have led to that point, that could be me!

I am looking for jobs that are either remote (US), or on the eastern seaboard (between DC and Boston), with a preference towards Boston.

### Previously

I was a Senior Software Engineer at Brilliant.org where I made interactive web tools to teach learners STEM.
I also made the tools to make interactives (Elm), the tools to make the tools (Vue, Django, Python, Typescript, CSS), the tools to make those tools (Python, bash, AWS, Heroku, GitHub Actions), as well as the training to go along.

Before I was at MIT, ostensibly doing grad school, but mostly teaching computer systems as a faculty-level instructor.

I once wrote a (very) fast [packet-level datacenter network simulator](https://github.com/nibrivia/rustasim) in Rust. If you're interested in it, or want to know more of how it works, contact me!

I also spent a year as a data analyst at [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/), a non-profit dedicated to teaching civics to millions of students every year.
They're an awesome group of people putting together excellent materials, go check them out!
