### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at [Column Tax](https://www.columntax.com/). 

### Recurse Center

I recently finished a batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2923690777cb854252b26e9468a08fbb) where I worked on:

 - [Oak](https://github.com/nibrivia/oak): a weirdly-typed programming language that breaks the fourth wall: what does it mean to have first-class types? first-class expressions? what even is evaluation, really? (writeup incoming!)
 - [CO2 bot](https://github.com/nibrivia/rc-CO2-bot) which checks the CO2 levels in the Recurse Center and messages out to the appropriate Zulip stream (Zulip stream ~== Slack channel)
 - [stRs](https://github.com/nibrivia/stRs), a quickly hacked together live desktop background (and [web app](https://nibrivia.shinyapps.io/stRs/)) that shows the relative position of the Earth, stars, and planets
 - Occasional, sporadic [blogging](https://nibrivia.com/)
 - (re)learning a bunch of stacks I've used, but never taken the time to deeply understand (ahem, CSS)
 - doing a bunch of miscellaneous projects on public transit, baseball, electricity markets, and more...


### Previously

I was a Senior Software Engineer at Brilliant.org where I made interactive web tools to teach learners STEM.
I also made the tools to make interactives (Elm), the tools to make the tools (Vue, Django, Python, Typescript, CSS), the tools to make those tools (Python, bash, AWS, Heroku, GitHub Actions), as well as the training to go along.

Before I was at MIT, ostensibly doing grad school, but mostly teaching computer systems as a faculty-level instructor.

I once wrote a (very) fast [packet-level datacenter network simulator](https://github.com/nibrivia/rustasim) in Rust. If you're interested in it, or want to know more of how it works, contact me!

I also spent a year as a data analyst at [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/), a non-profit dedicated to teaching civics to millions of students every year.
They're an awesome group of people putting together excellent materials, go check them out!
