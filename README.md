### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing a batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I'm working on:

 - Oak: a weirdly-typed programming language that breaks the fourth wall: what does it mean to have first-class types? first-class expressions? what even is evaluation, really? (writeup incoming!)
 - pairing with a lot of awesome folks!
 - "properly" learning a bunch of stacks I've used, but never taken the time to deeply understand (ahem, CSS)
 - doing a bunch of miscellaneous projects on public transit, baseball, electricity markets and more...

I will be looking for a job at the conclusion of the batch (mid February 2024), if you happen to be hiring, know of a job who would be a good fit, let me know :)

If you're a recruiter: _Hi! I hope you're having a wonderful day ðŸ’®_

### Previously

I was a Senior Software Engineer at Brilliant.org where I made interactive widgets to teach learners STEM.
I also made the tools to make interactives, the tools to make the tools, the tools to make those tools (and the training to go along).

Before I was at MIT, ostensibly doing grad school, but mostly teaching computer systems (OSes, Networks, Distributed Systems, Digital Design, Distributed Systems, Security) as a faculty-level instructor.

I also spent a year as a data analyst at [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/), a non-profit dedicated to teaching civics to millions of students every year.
They're an awesome group of people putting together excellent materials, go check them out!
